**The ultimate Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 3DMigoto-based UI modding, running natively inside Blender.**

---

## 🌌 Introduction

**RZMenu (RZM)** is a specialized **development suite** designed to revolutionize how UI mods are created for anime-style rendering games.

Unlike traditional methods that require manual config editing or external runtime libraries, RZM acts as a **smart compiler**. It takes high-level visual concepts (Qt widgets, nodes) and **injects** all necessary logic directly into the mod's native `.ini` files.

**The result?** A complex, feature-rich mod that requires **zero extra steps** for the end user.

**What does "RZ" stand for?**
* **R** — Rayvich (Me, Author, coder, but mostly vibe-coder)
* **Z** — Zlevir (Original inspiration & legacy tribute)

## 🚀 Key Features

RZM is built on a "One-Click" philosophy: complex under the hood, simple on the surface.

### 🎨 The Visual Editor (Qt Engine)
RZM launches a custom **PySide6** window that acts as a bridge between you and the raw code:
* **WYSIWYG Interface:** Drag-and-drop elements, resize handles, and alignment tools.
* **Hierarchy Management:** Dedicated Outliner for UI elements.
* **Inspector:** Real-time property editing.
* **Theme Engine:** Customizable workspace themes (Frutiger Aero included!).

### ⚡ Smart Compilation (The Magic)
* **Direct Injection:** The tool automatically generates and embeds all logic into the `.ini` file.
* **No Dependencies:** The final mod does not require the player to install RZM, python libraries, or any third-party loaders. It just works.
* **Autopilot Mode:** Automated generation for standard menu setups — from zero to working mod in seconds.

### 🛠 Advanced Tooling
* **Shader Snippets:** Pre-baked advanced effects (Trails, Texture Morphing, runtime Color Management).
* **Image Capture:** Auto-render blender scenes and inject them directly into the `.blend` file storage.
* **Seamless Integration:** Designed to work alongside **XXMI** for a unified export pipeline.

## 🏗 Architecture

RZM 3.1 utilizes a robust **Event-Driven MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to manage the complexity of UI generation.

### The Stack
* **Language:** Pure Python 3.11 (Embedded in Blender).
* **GUI Library:** PySide 6.10.1 (Qt for Python).
* **Core:** Custom logic generator that translates Python objects into 3DMigoto configuration.

### Data Flow
1.  **Model:** Blender Scene holds the "Source of Truth" in `bpy.scene_data`.
2.  **View:** The PySide6 Editor allows visual manipulation of this data.
3.  **Compiler:** Upon export, the system serializes the data and "bakes" it into the final mod format.
